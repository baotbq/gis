Plan for Connecting Google Maps API in React Application

Information Gathered:
- User wants to connect to Google Maps API in a React frontend app.
- No existing Google Maps integration found in the project.

Plan:
1. Explain how to obtain a Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console.
2. Show how to include the Google Maps JavaScript API script in a React app.
3. Provide a React component example that initializes and displays a Google Map.
4. Explain how to customize the map (e.g., markers, zoom, center).
5. Optionally mention libraries like @react-google-maps/api for easier integration.

Dependent Files to be edited:
- src/App.js (or create a new component file for the map)

Followup Steps:
- Provide instructions for testing the map display.
- Suggest next steps for adding more Google Maps features.

Please confirm if I can proceed with this plan.
